#How to integrate gwt-dialogs library into a Maven project

= Repository =
If you use Maven to build your project (what i personally recommend) you can easily set your project with gwt-dialogs by adding the following dependency to your pom.xml:
{{{
<dependency>
        <groupId>com.tinesoft</groupId>
        <artifactId>gwt-dialogs-library</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
}}}

The depencency will soon be published on Maven Central. So nothing more is required.

But until then, and if you want to use a snapshot (= under development) version of the library, you must add the following in the *`<`repositories`>`* section of your pom.xml:
{{{
<repository>
        <id>sonatype.snapshots</id>
        <name>Sonatype snapshot repository</name>
        <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>  
        <layout>default</layout>
</repository>
}}}
